sfm:MetamemeGenesis a sfm:Concept ;
    sfm:label "Metameme Genesis: Gödel Number, Proof, Genesis Block, Payment" ;
    sfm:description "The turning point of the metaprotocol: the Gödel number is the proof, is the genesis block, is the payment. The Metameme is a recursive, self-replicating unit of cultural evolution, with miners and validators extending the narrative and extracting value. Each proof is a new block, a new payment, and a new step in the chronicle of collective intelligence. Inspired by meta-meme issue #160." ;

    sfm:label "Emoji Prime Bootstrapping" ;
    sfm:description "Assigning prime numbers to foundational emojis (e.g., ⚫=2, ☀️=3, 💧=5, 🪴=7, ✨=11, etc.) enables symbolic computation, semantic transcription, and the emergence of a neo-symbolic mathematics. Emoji equations and combinatorics reveal deeper ontological and arithmological interrelations, opening new frontiers for symbolic reasoning and machinic cognition. Inspired by meta-meme issue #188." ;
