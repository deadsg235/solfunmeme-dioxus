The vibe is the vector is the number is the embedding is the string vibrating, contains the harmonies
which describe the structure contained in the number. Each prime factor contributes an exponent, multiple, or ratio, an addition or substration, in an operation 
that can be considered as a matrix or group or ring, or lava or category or topological or matematical or abstract or neuron or biosemiosis operation.

The system can refactor and rewrite itself into smaller and more useful components, or integrating open source libraries
to offload the work onto tested intefaces. 

Eventaully we can construct a single multi dimensional matrix that lets us apprehend
the entire project at a single glance, this dashboard can be seen as the throne or drivers seat
the main OODA loop, the playground where the kids can play without breaking the system.

This matrix will have a key that is traceable back to the sources, we can show for each patch what influenced it.
