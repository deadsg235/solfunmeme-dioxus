## Ontologies

Ontologies are central to the Code-Math Manifold, providing a structured, semantic understanding of code and its relationships. They define the concepts, properties, and relationships within our domain, enabling advanced analysis, reasoning, and visualization. Crucially, these ontologies will directly inform and be used in the project's evolving data schema, which is designed to be fluid and adaptable.

*   **`ontologies/project_ontology.ttl`**: The main project ontology in Turtle format, generated from analyzed code. *Refer here to understand the semantic structure derived from the codebase, which directly influences our fluid schema.*
*   **`ontologies/solfunmem.jsonld`**: A JSON-LD representation of core semantic concepts. *Refer here for a JSON-LD view of foundational semantic elements that contribute to the schema's flexibility.*
*   **`ontologies/zos/`**: Contains ZOS-specific ontology definitions. *Refer here for ontologies related to the ZOS (Zero-One-Space) framework, which will also be integrated into the fluid schema.*
