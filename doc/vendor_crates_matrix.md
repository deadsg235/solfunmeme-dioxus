## Vendor/Input Crates Matrix

Below are some of the key input and vendor crates used in this project. Each vendor crate represents a **recursive world** or **sphere of functionality**, acting as a **computational supplier** or **service provider** within our broader compute market. These provide foundational functionality, NLP, search, and integration capabilities.
