# Project Memories

This directory is for storing persistent project memories, context, and important decisions. Use it to record:

- Why certain architectural choices were made
- Key project conventions or workflows
- Reminders for future contributors
- AI/agent context that should persist across sessions

## Usage Examples

- `architecture-decisions.md`: Why we chose a specific framework or pattern
- `cli-usage-examples.md`: Common CLI commands and their purpose
- `ai-context.md`: Notes for AI agents to recall in future sessions

## Best Practices

- Add a new markdown file for each major topic or decision
- Reference this directory in the main README for discoverability
- Keep entries concise and up to date

This helps both humans and AI tools stay aligned and maintain project context over time.
