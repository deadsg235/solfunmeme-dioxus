# AI Agent Directives for `emoji_lang_plugin`

This document outlines specific guidelines for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `emoji_lang_plugin` crate.

## Core Principles

When working within `emoji_lang_plugin`, AI agents should prioritize:

1.  **Emoji-to-Semantic Mapping:** Ensure accurate and consistent mapping between emoji representations and their underlying semantic meanings.
2.  **Language Integration:** Facilitate the seamless integration of emoji-based language constructs into the application's workflows.
3.  **Extensibility:** Design the plugin to be easily extensible for new emoji mappings and language features.

## Operational Guidelines

*   **Ontology Alignment:** Ensure that emoji mappings are aligned with the project's semantic ontology.
*   **Parsing and Interpretation:** Implement robust parsing and interpretation of emoji sequences to derive their intended meaning.
*   **Error Handling:** Provide clear error handling for unresolvable emoji sequences or ambiguous mappings.
