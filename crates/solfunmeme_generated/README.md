# `solfunmeme_generated`

This crate serves as a container for automatically generated code within the Solfunmeme project.

## Purpose

It acts as a dedicated module for code that is produced by build scripts, procedural macros, or other automated processes. This separation ensures that hand-written code remains clean and distinct from generated artifacts, improving maintainability and clarity.

## Core Functionalities

-   **Code Storage**: Stores Rust code generated at compile-time or during build processes.
-   **Module Integration**: Provides a clear pathway for integrating generated code into the main application.

## Usage (Conceptual)

```rust
// use solfunmeme_generated::embedself;

// fn main() {
//     // Example: Call a generated function
//     // embedself::print_generated_info();
// }
```
