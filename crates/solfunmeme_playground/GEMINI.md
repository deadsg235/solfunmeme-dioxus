# AI Agent Directives for `solfunmeme_playground`

This document outlines specific guidelines for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `solfunmeme_playground` crate.

## Core Principles

When working within `solfunmeme_playground`, AI agents should prioritize:

1. **Experimentation**: Encourage creative exploration and experimentation with new features and concepts.
2. **Educational Value**: Design components that help users understand and learn about the Code-Math Manifold concepts.
3. **Interactive Experience**: Create engaging, interactive experiences that demonstrate the project's capabilities.
4. **Safety**: Ensure experimental features are safe to use and don't compromise system stability.

## Operational Guidelines

* **Feature Development**: When adding new experimental features, ensure they are clearly marked as experimental and provide appropriate warnings.
* **Visualization**: Create clear and informative visualizations for complex mathematical and data concepts.
* **Performance**: Monitor and optimize performance for interactive features, especially those involving real-time data or complex calculations.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation and examples for experimental features to help users understand their purpose and usage.
* **Integration**: Ensure playground components integrate well with the main application and other crates.
* **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing for experimental features to ensure they work correctly and safely.
* **User Feedback**: Design components to provide clear feedback and error messages to help users understand what's happening.
