# `model_lib`

This crate defines the core data models and structures used throughout the Solfunmeme Dioxus application.

## Purpose

It provides a consistent and type-safe representation of various entities and concepts within the application, such as user data, project information, and system states.

## Core Data Models

-   **`NotificationInfo`**: Represents information related to user notifications.
-   **`Route`**: Defines the application's routing structure.
-   **`LOGO`**: Placeholder for application logo data.
-   **`state`**: Represents the overall application state.
-   **`models`**: A module likely containing various other data models.

## Usage (Conceptual)

```rust
// Example of using data models
// use model_lib::{NotificationInfo, Route, LOGO, state, models};

// fn main() {
//     let notification = NotificationInfo { /* ... */ };
//     let current_route = Route::Home;
//     // ... other model usage ...
// }
```
