# `solfunmeme_extractor_system`

This crate provides system-level extraction functionalities for the Solfunmeme project, including clipboard operations, file processing, and code testing utilities.

## Purpose

It serves as a low-level system interface for extracting and processing data from various sources, providing utilities for clipboard management, file operations, and code validation.

## Core Functionalities

- **Clipboard Operations**: Interact with system clipboard for data extraction and manipulation
- **File Processing**: Process files and extract relevant information
- **Code Testing**: Validate and test code snippets and files
- **System Integration**: Provide system-level utilities for data extraction

## Usage (Conceptual)

```rust
use solfunmeme_extractor_system::{clipboard, process_file, test_code};

fn main() {
    // Example: Extract from clipboard
    // let clipboard_data = clipboard::extract().expect("Failed to extract from clipboard");
    
    // Example: Process a file
    // let file_data = process_file::process("path/to/file").expect("Failed to process file");
    
    // Example: Test code
    // let test_result = test_code::validate("fn main() {}").expect("Failed to validate code");
}
```
