# AI Agent Directives for `solfunmeme_tarot`

This document outlines specific guidelines for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `solfunmeme_tarot` crate.

## Core Principles

When working within `solfunmeme_tarot`, AI agents should prioritize:

1.  **Conceptual Integrity:** Ensure that the implementation of the Tarot deck aligns with the project's core "Digital Secretome Tarot" concept and the "Market Maker" metaphor.
2.  **Qabalistic Accuracy:** Maintain accurate correspondences between Tarot cards, Hebrew letters, and other Qabalistic elements.
3.  **Extensibility:** Design the crate to be easily extensible for new decks, interpretations, and integrations.

## Operational Guidelines

*   **Data Modeling:** Model Tarot cards and their attributes in a way that is both semantically rich and computationally efficient.
*   **Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with other crates, particularly `solfunmeme_models`, `solfunmeme_analysis`, and the emoji ontology.
*   **Documentation:** Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for all data structures, functions, and concepts.
