# AI Agent Directives for `nlprule_plugin`

This document outlines specific guidelines for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `nlprule_plugin` crate.

## Core Principles

When working within `nlprule_plugin`, AI agents should prioritize:

1.  **Grammar and Style Checking Accuracy:** Ensure high accuracy in identifying and suggesting corrections for grammar, spelling, and style issues using NLPrule.
2.  **Performance:** Optimize the plugin for efficient processing of text, minimizing latency during checks.
3.  **Rule Management:** Facilitate effective management and application of NLPrule's linguistic rules.

## Operational Guidelines

*   **Text Processing:** Handle text input and output correctly, ensuring proper encoding and formatting.
*   **Rule Application:** Apply NLPrule's rules effectively to detect and suggest corrections for linguistic errors.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for NLPrule operations, providing clear feedback in case of failures.
