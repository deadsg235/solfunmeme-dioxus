# AI Agent Directives for `model2vec_rs_plugin`

This document outlines specific guidelines for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `model2vec_rs_plugin` crate.

## Core Principles

When working within `model2vec_rs_plugin`, AI agents should prioritize:

1.  **Accurate Model Embeddings:** Ensure the accurate generation of vector representations for various models or data structures.
2.  **Performance:** Optimize the embedding process for speed and efficiency.
3.  **Model Integration:** Facilitate seamless integration and usage of different model-to-vector techniques.

## Operational Guidelines

*   **Data Representation:** Handle the input data or model structures correctly for embedding.
*   **Embedding Algorithms:** Apply appropriate embedding algorithms based on the nature of the model or data.
*   **Error Handling:** Provide robust error handling for embedding generation and related operations.
