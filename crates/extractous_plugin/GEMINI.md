# AI Agent Directives for `extractous_plugin`

This document outlines specific guidelines for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `extractous_plugin` crate.

## Core Principles

When working within `extractous_plugin`, AI agents should prioritize:

1.  **Accurate Data Extraction:** Ensure precise and reliable extraction of structured and unstructured data from various sources.
2.  **Robustness:** Design the plugin to handle diverse data formats and potential inconsistencies gracefully.
3.  **Efficiency:** Optimize extraction processes for speed and resource utilization.

## Operational Guidelines

*   **Source Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with the intended data sources (e.g., HTML, PDF, plain text).
*   **Pattern Matching:** Implement effective pattern matching and parsing logic for data extraction.
*   **Error Handling:** Provide comprehensive error handling for extraction failures or malformed input.
