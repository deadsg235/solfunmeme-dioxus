# AI Agent Directives for `gline_rs_plugin`

This document outlines specific guidelines for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `gline_rs_plugin` crate.

## Core Principles

When working within `gline_rs_plugin`, AI agents should prioritize:

1.  **Graph Analysis Accuracy:** Ensure accurate and efficient analysis of graph structures using gline-rs.
2.  **Performance:** Optimize graph processing for speed and resource usage.
3.  **Graph Data Integration:** Facilitate seamless integration of graph data into the application's workflows.

## Operational Guidelines

*   **Graph Representation:** Handle graph data structures correctly (e.g., adjacency lists, matrices).
*   **Algorithm Implementation:** Implement graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, centrality) accurately.
*   **Error Handling:** Provide robust error handling for graph operations.
