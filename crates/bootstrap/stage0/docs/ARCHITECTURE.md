# Bootstrap Stage 0 Architecture

## System Overview

The Bootstrap Stage 0 microkernel implements a minimal, self-contained foundation for the solfunmeme-dioxus ecosystem. It provides the essential building blocks for a content-addressable, extensible system with zero external dependencies.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Minimalism
- **Zero Dependencies**: No external crates beyond Rust standard library
- **Essential Only**: Only core functionality required for bootstrap
- **Self-Contained**: Complete functionality within the crate

### 2. Content-Addressable Storage
- **Hash-Based Identity**: All data identified by cryptographic hash
- **Immutable References**: Content cannot change without new hash
- **Deduplication**: Identical content produces identical hashes

### 3. Pluggable Architecture
- **Trait-Based Interfaces**: All major components defined by traits
- **Dynamic Replacement**: Components can be swapped at runtime
- **Extensible Design**: New implementations can be added without core changes

### 4. Univalence Implementation
- **Identity as Path**: System identity maintained through transformation history
- **Equivalence Proofs**: Cryptographic proof of identity continuity
- **Rewrite Tracking**: All component changes recorded and verifiable

### 5. Ouroboros Cycle
- **42-Step Process**: Finite cycle of system renewal
- **Self-Reference**: System consumes and renews itself
- **Evolution Tracking**: Each rewrite advances the cycle

## Component Architecture

### Kernel (`kernel.rs`)
The central orchestrator that manages all other components.

```rust
pub struct Kernel {
    pub step: u64,                    // Current position in 42-step cycle
    store: ChordStore,                // Distributed storage
    verifier: Box<dyn ProofVerifier>, // Cryptographic verification
    projector: Box<dyn ManifoldProjector>, // Geometric projection
    hasher: Box<dyn Hasher>,          // Content hashing
    pub history: EquivalenceProof,    // Rewrite history
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinate component interactions
- Manage the 42-step cycle
- Track rewrite history
- Provide unified interface for system operations

### Artifact (`artifact.rs`)
Content-addressable data units that form the basis of all storage.

```rust
pub struct Artifact {
    pub content: Vec<u8>,    // Raw binary content
    pub hashes: Vec<Hash>,   // Multiple hash identifiers
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Implements `Describable` trait for canonical representation
- Supports multiple hashes for different algorithms
- Content determines identity

### Hash System (`hash.rs`)
Generic hash representation supporting multiple algorithms.

```rust
pub struct Hash {
    pub algorithm_id: u64,   // Identifies hashing algorithm
    pub hash_bytes: Vec<u8>, // Raw hash output
}

pub trait Hasher {
    fn algorithm_id(&self) -> u64;
    fn hash(&self, data: &[u8]) -> Hash;
}
```

**Design Benefits:**
- Algorithm agnostic
- Supports migration between hash functions
- Enables multi-hash verification

### Manifold Projection (`manifold.rs`)
8-dimensional geometric space for spatial data representation.

```rust
pub struct Coordinate(pub [f64; 8]);

pub trait ManifoldProjector {
    fn project(&self, hash: &Hash) -> Coordinate;
}
```

**Mathematical Properties:**
- 8D unit hypersphere surface
- Normalized coordinates (magnitude ≤ 1)
- Deterministic projection from hash

### Chord Store (`chord.rs`)
Distributed hash table for scalable artifact storage.

```rust
pub struct ChordStore {
    // Internal implementation details
}
```

**Features:**
- Distributed storage simulation
- Hash-based routing
- Scalable lookup performance

### Proof System (`proof.rs`, `verifier.rs`)
Cryptographic verification and proof generation.

```rust
pub struct Proof {
    pub hash: Hash,
    pub content: Vec<u8>,
    pub metadata: ProofMetadata,
}

pub trait ProofVerifier {
    fn ingest_proof(&mut self, proof: Proof) -> Result<(), &'static str>;
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- Content integrity verification
- Cryptographic proof generation
- Metadata validation

### Univalence (`univalence.rs`)
Identity transformation tracking and equivalence proofs.

```rust
pub struct EquivalenceProof {
    pub path: Vec<RewriteOp>,
}

pub enum RewriteOp {
    UpdateHasher,
    UpdateProjector,
    // Additional operations as needed
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Records all system transformations
- Maintains identity through changes
- Provides cryptographic continuity

## Data Flow

### 1. Artifact Storage
```
Content → Hasher → Hash → ChordStore → ManifoldProjection → Coordinate
```

### 2. Component Rewrite
```
OldComponent → Kernel.rewrite_*() → NewComponent → History.Update → Cycle.Advance
```

### 3. Identity Verification
```
Artifact → Hash → Proof → Verifier → EquivalenceProof → Identity.Continuity
```

## Security Model

### Content Integrity
- All content verified through cryptographic hashing
- Immutable references prevent tampering
- Multiple hash algorithms provide redundancy

### Identity Continuity
- Equivalence proofs maintain system identity
- Rewrite history provides audit trail
- Cryptographic verification of transformations

### Isolation
- Zero external dependencies reduce attack surface
- Pluggable components enable security upgrades
- Deterministic behavior prevents side-channel attacks

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **Hash Generation**: O(n) where n is content size
- **Manifold Projection**: O(1) for fixed-size hashes
- **Chord Store Lookup**: O(log n) for n stored artifacts
- **Component Rewrite**: O(1) for cycle advancement

### Space Complexity
- **Artifact Storage**: O(n) for n artifacts
- **Hash Storage**: O(1) per artifact
- **History Tracking**: O(m) for m rewrite operations
- **Manifold Coordinates**: O(1) per artifact

## Extensibility Points

### 1. New Hash Algorithms
Implement `Hasher` trait and register algorithm ID.

### 2. Alternative Projections
Implement `ManifoldProjector` trait for different geometric mappings.

### 3. Storage Backends
Replace `ChordStore` with alternative storage implementations.

### 4. Verification Methods
Implement `ProofVerifier` trait for custom verification logic.

### 5. Rewrite Operations
Add new variants to `RewriteOp` enum for additional transformation types.
