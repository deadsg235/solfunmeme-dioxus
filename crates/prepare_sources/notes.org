1. use the ontology from the ttl
   if the item is not in the list we find the 3 closets emojis and add those in for the word.
   only vectorize the sums not the individual items
   save the vectors generated in a file for reuse, as an rdf ontology.
   dont print all the filenames, use a progress bar for the output.
