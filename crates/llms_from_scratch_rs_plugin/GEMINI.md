# AI Agent Directives for `llms_from_scratch_rs_plugin`

This document outlines specific guidelines for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `llms_from_scratch_rs_plugin` crate.

## Core Principles

When working within `llms_from_scratch_rs_plugin`, AI agents should prioritize:

1.  **LLM Implementation Accuracy:** Ensure the correct and faithful implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) from scratch.
2.  **Educational Clarity:** Design the code to be clear, well-commented, and easy to understand for educational purposes.
3.  **Performance (within educational context):** While not production-grade, strive for reasonable performance for demonstration and learning.

## Operational Guidelines

*   **Architectural Fidelity:** Adhere to the architectural principles of the LLMs being implemented (e.g., Transformer, RNN).
*   **Mathematical Correctness:** Ensure all mathematical operations and algorithms are correctly translated into code.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for common issues during model training or inference.
