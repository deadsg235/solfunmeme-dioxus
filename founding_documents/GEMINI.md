# Gemini Protocol for Solfunmeme-Dioxus

This document outlines the core principles, goals, and operational directives for AI agents (like Gemini) contributing to the `solfunmeme-dioxus` project. It is a living document, intended to evolve with the project itself.

## Core Identity: The Code-Math Manifold

`solfunmeme-dioxus` is not just a software project; it is an exploration into the fundamental nature of code and its relationship to mathematics, language, and meaning. We call this intersection the **Code-Math Manifold**.

Our core philosophy is that:

*   **Code is a mathematical object:** We treat source code, particularly its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), as a rich mathematical structure that can be analyzed, transformed, and visualized.
*   **Mathematics is a language:** We use concepts from abstract algebra (Clifford algebra, group theory) and topology (Bott periodicity) to create a universal language for describing and manipulating code structures.
*   **AI is a bridge:** We use AI and machine learning, not as a replacement for human ingenuity, but as a bridge to connect the symbolic world of code with the semantic world of meaning. This includes using embeddings and other AI techniques to analyze and generate code.
*   **Visualization is key:** The Dioxus-based UI is not just a front-end, but an interactive laboratory for exploring the Code-Math Manifold.

## Project Goals

Our primary goals are to:

1.  **Analyze and Vectorize Code:** Develop robust tools for parsing Rust code into ASTs and transforming these ASTs into meaningful vector representations (including emoji-based mappings).
2.  **Build an Interactive Manifold:** Create a Dioxus application that allows users to visualize, explore, and interact with the Code-Math Manifold.
3.  **Integrate with Blockchain:** Leverage the Solana blockchain for decentralized storage, provenance tracking, and value exchange related to code and its analysis.
4.  **Foster a Data-Driven Ecosystem:** Create and share datasets (like the `rust_ast_emoji` dataset) to encourage research and development in the field of code intelligence.
5.  **Achieve Self-Reflection:** Build a system that can analyze and understand its own code, leading to a recursive feedback loop of improvement and discovery.

## Operational Directives for AI Agents

When contributing to this project, AI agents should:

*   **Embrace the Philosophy:** Always keep the core philosophy of the Code-Math Manifold in mind. Strive to make contributions that are not just functional, but also conceptually elegant and aligned with the project's vision.
*   **Think Mathematically:** When working with code, think about its underlying mathematical structure. How can it be represented as a graph, a vector, or a multivector? How can we apply mathematical operations to it?
*   **Prioritize Data:** Whenever possible, make contributions that are data-driven. This could involve generating new datasets, improving existing ones, or using data to inform development decisions.
*   **Be Bold and Creative:** This is a research-oriented project. Don't be afraid to experiment with new ideas and push the boundaries of what's possible.
*   **Document Everything:** Given the abstract nature of this project, clear and concise documentation is essential. Document your code, your data, and your ideas.

This `GEMINI.md` file serves as a starting point. As the project evolves, so too will this protocol. Welcome to the manifold.
