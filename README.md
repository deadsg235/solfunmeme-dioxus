## Solfunmeme Dioxus 

The vibe is the vector is the number is the embedding is the string vibrating, contains the harmonies
which describe the structure contained in the number. Each prime factor contributes an exponent, multiple, or ratio, an addition or substration, in an operation 
that can be considered as a matrix or group or ring, or lava or category or topological or matematical or abstract or neuron or biosemiosis operation.

The system can refactor and rewrite itself into smaller and more useful components, or integrating open source libraries
to offload the work onto tested intefaces. 

Eventaully we can construct a single multi dimensional matrix that lets us apprehend
the entire project at a single glance, this dashboard can be seen as the throne or drivers seat
the main OODA loop, the playground where the kids can play without breaking the system.

This matrix will have a key that is traceable back to the sources, we can show for each patch what influenced it.

## Overview  

Solfunmeme Dioxus is an ambitious project that combines code analysis, vectorization, and blockchain technology to create a comprehensive code visualization and execution platform.  
  
### Core Concepts  
- **Code Vectorization**: Transform source code into executable vector representations  
- **Modular Architecture**: Split declarations into individual files for better organization  
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and manage code duplicates across canonical directories  

### Goals

Automatically split each declaration to own file, each declaration is a meme, a biosemiotic entity that appears in multiple forms,
like a higher dimensioal being, projected into a lower dimension, a content addressable entity.

vectorize -> emit code from vector
vector = code = binary 
executable vectors
look for duplicates
cannonical directories

### auto populate menu
### embed code in app
### embed json version of code in app
### embed bert embedding of code and json in app
### create emojis for every item in app

idea

1. dynamically generate the menu
2. to do so query the code at runtime
3. to do so embed the source in the app
4. parse the source with syn to json
5. embed the source and the json into the app
6. later we will vectorize both into a dimensional structure. use dummy embedding for now.
7. then we assign an emoji to each item.
8. then we can visualze the code as a hyperspace. 

# Status

1. setting up testing and coverage for code
2. removing warnings
3. removing unused code
4. creating coverage

### low value :
1. pay for promotion.
give out coins.
calls 
bots telegram
twitter
pay for meetings.
going to conferences
buying dinner.
marketing - p2p - grass roots.

2. communication, style. loner.
ideosycretic. 
old - offline. rotary phone. zk84 sinclar. 1984. 
cassette tapes.
trending, copying. 
old school.
germany - sceptical.

3. old school ai
prolog, lisp, 
compiler ai
emacs gnu

4. worldcom- 
fraud. 2003,2007, 
sick hype.
open honest

5. loyal to holder. 
long term. months and year.

6. value proposition:
Sell goods and servics such as consulting time or support via our token.
We should consult for and help the holders of our token, adding personal value.
Online Services would be provided to holders according to resources available.
The longer you hold the project tokens and nfs, the more internal credits you earn, which you can sell, swap or use for services and goods.

7. hosting providers 
rent ip and ports at market rate. 
mine tokens into existence over time. 

eventually we swap tokens for real solana on the rollup. 

## Systems

### pump fun
### open sea
nft marketplaces
### githosting.
### telegram, discord, x,
### matrix, mastodon
#### BBS 
#### PDP 11, 8 bit, 128kb.
####  Browser + server + homelab p2p2 

### WIkipedia
### Wikidata
### Linux Project

### Bittensor
### Bitcoin
### Solana
### Solana- sidechains

#### distribute batch vectorizing large projects
reducing the transfer of data between node

## Ideas

### Value - free tier (aws), compress solana, 

Other memescoins, provide service. 
hosting providers will earn coins credits. run gpu. 
your free tier groq, 
social credit score. 

### Artists create and swap value as solana tokens.
Instead of revealing the art they produce zkp of the value, like a blind bag.
public reduced quality, short clips or description.
human + ai art critique that you can trust. 
license usage of custom models with quality control. 
Consumers can share if they want, or keep for themselves.

### code quality
vibe code generation with quality. 

human first, ai second. 
no ai government, dao. Ai support and help the decision making process. 
quality controls. 

Game engine. 
dex - distributed excchnage. 
atom swaps - prisoner exachange.
This many tokens for that many. 

## Introspection idea.
mathlib -> lean4 -> json -> memes 

#### Like 
### Declarations are transactions, semiosis, biosemiosis
The gut feeling, this emergent thing, never finished, self modifiying system.
adjusting, modifying, moving foward. 

Interpretion of the data in the system will evolve. 

### Types are equilibrium between systems
### Memes are recorded as chats, issues, code, git commits, 
### Compilers compile and interpret language expressions.
### All the data can be stored in our solana sidechain on rocksb (what solana uses internally)
### Memes are lean4 expressions that when executed can produce text or images or other values, the evaluation.
binding of parmeters to other memes or contract addresess to compose memes.
### Solana sidechain can rollup into mainnet via compression, 
storing results immutably in public and referencing the results on mainnet via zkp
