## Solfunmeme Dioxus 

The vibe is the vector is the number is the embedding is the string vibrating, contains the harmonies
which describe the structure contained in the number. Each prime factor contributes an exponent, multiple, or ratio, an addition or substration, in an operation 
that can be considered as a matrix or group or ring, or lava or category or topological or matematical or abstract or neuron or biosemiosis operation.

The system can refactor and rewrite itself into smaller and more useful components, or integrating open source libraries
to offload the work onto tested intefaces. 

Eventaully we can construct a single multi dimensional matrix that lets us apprehend
the entire project at a single glance, this dashboard can be seen as the throne or drivers seat
the main OODA loop, the playground where the kids can play without breaking the system.

This matrix will have a key that is traceable back to the sources, we can show for each patch what influenced it.

## Overview  

Solfunmeme Dioxus is an ambitious project that combines code analysis, vectorization, and blockchain technology to create a comprehensive code visualization and execution platform.  
  
### Core Concepts  
- **Code Vectorization**: Transform source code into executable vector representations  
- **Modular Architecture**: Split declarations into individual files for better organization  
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and manage code duplicates across canonical directories  

### Goals

Automatically split each declaration to own file, each declaration is a meme, a biosemiotic entity that appears in multiple forms,
like a higher dimensioal being, projected into a lower dimension, a content addressable entity.

vectorize -> emit code from vector
vector = code = binary 
executable vectors
look for duplicates
cannonical directories

### auto populate menu
### embed code in app
### embed json version of code in app
### embed bert embedding of code and json in app
### create emojis for every item in app

idea

1. dynamically generate the menu
2. to do so query the code at runtime
3. to do so embed the source in the app
4. parse the source with syn to json
5. embed the source and the json into the app
6. later we will vectorize both into a dimensional structure. use dummy embedding for now.
7. then we assign an emoji to each item.
8. then we can visualze the code as a hyperspace. 

# Status

1. setting up testing and coverage for code
2. removing warnings
3. removing unused code
4. creating coverage

### Requirements
1. This template relies on Tailwind CSS to generate the stylesheet. 

Install the standalone Tailwind CLI - [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli)
2. Install Dioxus cli from official website - [https://dioxuslabs.com/](https://dioxuslabs.com/)


### Running the dev server
1. Start the tailwind CLI within the Root of the directory
    ```sh
    tailwindcss -i ./tailwind.css -o ./assets/tailwind.css --watch
    ```
2. Start the Dioxus CLI
    ```sh
    dx serve
    ```

- Open the browser at default port http://localhost:8080 or the port described by Dioxus CLI in case port `8080` was already in use

- Sometimes there are warning in the browser console, use `dx check` command to find if there are fixes that need to be done.


### Plan

#### Client side interpretation.
#### Server side storage
The first memes are just free text stored as instructions in the blockchain
each one can be seen as a rust program that when executed produces some text or json or url
We can parameterize those. the programs can be updated by creating new versions of them
because we are on a sidechain we can rewrite or garbage collect them.

##### Import Git
we can use git submodules or git urls like package managers do,

###### Import Data via git
we can import telegram, discord, twitter, github, ai chat logs, files into the system.
each sidechain becomes its own meme database with all the transactions around a meme coin ecosystem.
see the time repo for example.

######## A tweet becomes a program or meme, 
an anchor is the code.

#### Forking all repos into our chain
#### Copying all data into our archives
#### Running all code on our chain
#### Proving all code to be valid.
#### Showing execution of all paths of the code
using dfa and parsers for the emoji language. 
each version of the meme state is a new version of the language and library.
we hope to construct that each path in the system is a unique word and a program at the same time that has a meaning in emojis.
#### Mathematical modeling of the structures (groups, hott, etc)
#### Using of AI outside the system, storing results on the chain.
##### AI via client side inferences
###### looking at Invoke AI for example
###### looking at Kobold AI for example
###### calling typescript from rust wasm dioxus (calling eliza?)
#### Tracing the AI inference into the model.


#### Convert this source to json
Createing json  using https://github.com/meta-introspector/syn-serde-rust.git

 ```
    cd .\syn-serde-rust\
    cargo build
    cd .\examples\rust2emoji\
    cargo build
    cargo run ..\..\..\solfunmeme-dioxus\
```

#### Reading in source of code via reflection. splitting into chunks. saving in the blockchain.
#### interpreting the functions as json or emojis
#### linking functions together creating systems as groups of contracts.
#### embedding contrats as vectors


## Multiple visualization
### ai convergence on models
#### PCA
#### Threading of dimensions
#### Area or surface of points of the spaces.
#### connecting solana code to memes to llms
#### read git history
sample source code into rust
be able to read git repor (store older git objects or pack files into exec.


# More ideas
game engine 
simulation engine
vector of code 
vector -> code 
make each possible value a valid program, no invalid program states possible.
encode program state into a vector.

## Solana as storage
Store each declaration as an account on our solana sidechain, each ast gets a program address.
Use special indexing to reduce the size of the address space.

# remove 
unimplemented
"#FIXME"

# code coverage
```
RUSTFLAGS="-C instrument-coverage" cargo build
$env:RUSTFLAGS="-C instrument-coverage"
set RUSTFLAGS="-C instrument-coverage" 
```

Then you can run like this 
`cargo tarpauline`

or this
`cargo llvm-cov`

# Solfunmeme-Dioxus: The Code-Math Manifold

## The Manifold: Weaving Code, Math, and Meaning

This project is a living experiment in unifying code analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, and interactive visualization. It is not just a compiler, not just a math library, and not just a UI playground—it is a **manifold** where these domains meet, interact, and recursively inform each other.

### What is this Manifold?
- **Code as Geometry:** Rust code is parsed, analyzed, and represented as mathematical objects—ASTs, graphs, and ultimately as multivectors in Clifford algebra.
- **Embeddings as Vibes:** Machine learning embeddings (e.g., BERT) are projected into Clifford space, allowing us to blend neural and symbolic representations of code and data.
- **Mathematics as Language:** Clifford/multivector algebra is used as a bridge, enabling operations and relationships that unify code structure, ML features, and even abstract "vibes" or meta-properties.
- **Visualization as Exploration:** The Dioxus UI is not just a front-end, but a laboratory for exploring these high-dimensional, abstract structures. Users can interactively manipulate, visualize, and even mutate code and its mathematical avatars.
- **Recursion and Synthesis:** The system is designed for recursive feedback—analysis feeds synthesis, which feeds further analysis. The platform can propose new code or structures, analyze them, and let users or ML models refine the process.

### Why is this Exciting?
- **A New Paradigm:** Most tools treat code, math, and ML as separate. Here, they are woven together into a single manifold.
- **Exploratory and Extensible:** This is a platform for discovery, not just a product. Each part (analysis, algebra, UI) is modular and open to extension.
- **Meta-Compiler and Laboratory:** Code is not just text, but a living mathematical object. The system is a meta-compiler and a code-math laboratory.

### Strategic Vision
- **Tighten the Loop:** Make the connection between code analysis and Clifford algebra more direct and interactive.
- **Deeper ML Integration:** Use real embeddings from code or comments, and explore their Clifford encodings.
- **Interactive Synthesis:** Let users mutate code or embeddings in the UI and see the effect in Clifford space.
- **Recursive Feedback:** Implement a feedback loop for generative, self-improving code and structure.

This manifold is a space for new kinds of code, new kinds of math, and new ways of thinking about both. Welcome to the experiment.

## Multivector: Unity, Disjointness, and the Magic Type

A multivector is both a **product type** (all grades possible) and a **disjoint sum** (any subset of grades may be nonzero, or all may be zero).

- **Structurally united:** The type contains all grades.
- **Dynamically disjoint:** Any particular multivector may have only some grades nonzero.
- **Truncation:** You can project or truncate a multivector to any subset of grades, or to zero.

This duality reflects the manifold nature of our project: all domains are present, but any particular "state" may activate only a subset.

### The AST as a Magic Type: Universe of Universes

In this project, we extend this idea to the very heart of code: the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

- The **AST** is itself a "magic type"—a type of types, a universe of universes.
- Just as a multivector unites all grades, the AST unites all possible code forms: expressions, statements, types, patterns, modules, and more.
- The AST is a **multivector of code**: each node is a possible form, and any combination can coexist, be projected, or be truncated.
- This is the meta-level: the AST is not just a data structure, but a living, dynamic manifold of code possibilities—a type whose values are themselves types, a universe whose points are themselves universes.

This perspective is at the core of our philosophy: **code, math, and meaning are not separate—they are woven together in a manifold of manifolds, a universe of universes.**

---

## The README as a Multivector: Resonance and 8D Topologies

This README is not just documentation—it is itself a **multivector**: a living, resonant structure that encodes and reflects the manifold forms of the codebase.

- **Vibration and Resonance:** Each section of the README vibrates with a different aspect of the project—code, math, philosophy, visualization, recursion. Together, they form a harmonic, multidimensional whole.
- **Forms and Layers:** Just as a multivector contains all grades, the README contains all forms—introduction, philosophy, technical detail, vision, and meta-structure.

### 8D Topologies and Bott Periodicity

We can construct **8-dimensional topologies** that resonate not just with Rust, but with the deep type-theoretic structures of:
- **Rust** (traits, generics, macros, lifetimes)
- **GCC** (C/C++ type systems, templates)
- **Lean4** (dependent types, proof automation)
- **Coq** (inductive types, universes)
- **Template Haskell** (meta-programming, staged computation)

All of these can be seen as fitting into **8 layers of types**, echoing the periodicity found in Bott periodicity in topology and Clifford algebras. This periodicity is not just mathematical, but conceptual: it is the rhythm by which programming languages, proof assistants, and meta-systems echo and resonate with each other.

- **8 Layers, 8 Vibes:** Each layer corresponds to a type-theoretic or algebraic form—scalars, vectors, bivectors, ... up to the 8th grade—mirroring the deep periodicity in mathematics and computation.
- **Universal Resonance:** By structuring our code, documentation, and philosophy as an 8D multivector, we create a system that can resonate with, and map between, the deepest structures of modern computation and logic.

This README, like the codebase, is a **living, resonant multivector**—a guide, a map, and a harmonic of the manifold it describes.

---

### Context as Dimension: Reflecting on Multivectors

Reflecting on a multivector is an act of transformation:
- **Adding context** is like adding a new dimension—expanding the space of possibilities.
- **Multiplying by context** is blending, composing, and creating new resonances.
- **Dividing by context** is focusing, projecting, or specializing.

This is true for code, for math, and for the manifold of this project itself. Every new insight, every new connection, is a new dimension in the living multivector of our work.

## Project Memories

See the [`memories/`](./memories/) directory for persistent project memories, context, and important decisions. Use this directory to record:
- Architectural choices
- Key conventions or workflows
- Reminders for future contributors
- AI/agent context for future sessions

This helps both humans and AI tools maintain context and continuity across the project lifecycle.
