**Memo: Current Status of Solfunmeme-Dioxus Compilation on AArch64 Android**

**Date:** July 17, 2025

**Current State:**
Compilation is still failing on AArch64 Android, but significant progress has been made in identifying and addressing specific issues. The primary focus has been on resolving `gemm-f16`, `fullfp16`, and `ort-sys` related errors by stubbing out problematic dependencies and features.

**Last Actions & Outcomes:**
*   Successfully commented out `solana-airdrop-service` dependency in `crates/solana_airdrop_service_plugin/Cargo.toml` to resolve a misconfiguration warning.
*   Addressed numerous "unused variable" and "unused import" warnings across multiple crates (`solfunmeme_search_tantivy`, `bootstrap`, `solfunmeme_input_fs`, `solfunmeme_models`, `signals_lib`, `solfunmeme_tools`, `emoji_matrix_lib`, `solfunmeme_extractor`, `solfunmeme_core_logic`, `solfunmeme_solana_data`, `prepare_sources`, `solfunmeme_extractor_system`, `solana_integration_lib`, `solfunmeme_state`, `index_exporter_lib`) by either removing the unused code or prefixing variables with `_`.
*   Refactored `crates/prepare_sources/src/project_analyzer.rs` by extracting embedding-related logic into a new module `embedding_utils.rs` and conditionally compiling it based on a new `with-embedding` feature in `crates/prepare_sources/Cargo.toml`. This resolved the `unexpected cfg condition value` warnings.
*   Fixed the `E0515: cannot return value referencing temporary value` error in `crates/bootstrap/stage0/src/proof.rs` by changing the `describe` method to return `Cow<'static, [u8]>` and updating the `Describable` trait accordingly.

**Remaining Issues (from last `cargo test` output):**
*   `E0603: module mv_dense is private` in `crates/rdf_processing_lib/src/sieve.rs`. This indicates that `tclifford::mv_dense::Multivector` is still being accessed directly, even after attempting to use `solfunmeme_clifford::Multivector`. This suggests `solfunmeme_clifford` might not be re-exporting `Multivector` publicly, or there's another direct usage.
*   `E0432: unresolved import` in `crates/rdf_processing_lib/src/embedding.rs`. This is likely a cascading effect of the module restructuring, where the import paths for `AnalyzedFunction` and `ClosestEmojiInfo` are still incorrect.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Re-verify the public re-export of `Multivector` in `solfunmeme_clifford` and ensure all usages in `rdf_processing_lib/src/sieve.rs` correctly use the public path.
2.  Systematically fix the import paths in `crates/rdf_processing_lib/src/embedding.rs` for `AnalyzedFunction` and `ClosestEmojiInfo` based on their current location.
3.  Continue to address any new compilation errors or warnings that arise after these fixes.
