**Memo: Current Status of Solfunmeme-Dioxus Compilation on AArch64 Android**

**Date:** July 18, 2025

**Current State:**
`cargo test` is failing due to `gemm-f16` and `fullfp16` errors, indicating a transitive dependency on `gemm-common` that is still being compiled on AArch64 Android. This is despite previous attempts to prune GEMM-related dependencies.

**Last Actions & Outcomes:**
*   Commented out `candle` dependencies and `gpu_backend` feature in `crates/rdf_processing_lib/Cargo.toml`.

**Remaining Issues (from last `cargo test` output):**
*   `gemm-f16` and `fullfp16` errors during `cargo test`.

**Next Immediate Steps (Smaller Steps Focus):**
1.  **Inspect `vendor/llms-from-scratch-rs/Cargo.toml`:** Identify and comment out any remaining `candle` or other potential GEMM-related dependencies.
2.  **Inspect `vendor/candle/Cargo.toml`:** If `llms-from-scratch-rs` is clean, then `candle` itself might be the direct culprit. Comment out its `gemm` related features/dependencies.
3.  **Re-run `cargo test --workspace --package solfunmeme_tarot`:** Continue to use targeted testing to minimize build time and quickly identify the next point of failure.
4.  **If `cargo tree` fails:** Prioritize fixing the manifest of the failing crate (e.g., adding `[lib]` section and `src/lib.rs`) before attempting to use `cargo tree` for dependency analysis.

**Overall Strategy:** Continue to systematically identify and comment out any dependencies that pull in `gemm-common` or other problematic libraries on AArch64 Android, focusing on one small change at a time and re-testing immediately.
