Solfunmeme Dioxus is an ambitious project that combines code analysis, vectorization, and blockchain technology to create a comprehensive code visualization and execution platform.  
  
### Core Concepts  
- **Code Vectorization**: Transform source code into executable vector representations  
- **Modular Architecture**: Split declarations into individual files for better organization  
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and manage code duplicates across canonical directories  

### Goals

Automatically split each declaration to own file, each declaration is a meme, a biosemiotic entity that appears in multiple forms,
like a higher dimensioal being, projected into a lower dimension, a content addressable entity.

vectorize -> emit code from vector
vector = code = binary 
executable vectors
look for duplicates
cannonical directories

### auto populate menu
### embed code in app
### embed json version of code in app
### embed bert embedding of code and json in app
### create emojis for every item in app

idea

1. dynamically generate the menu
2. to do so query the code at runtime
3. to do so embed the source in the app
4. parse the source with syn to json
5. embed the source and the json into the app
6. later we will vectorize both into a dimensional structure. use dummy embedding for now.
7. then we assign an emoji to each item.
8. then we can visualze the code as a hyperspace.
