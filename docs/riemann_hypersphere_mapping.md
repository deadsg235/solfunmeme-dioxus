# Riemann Hypersphere Mapping and Module Orchestration

This document outlines the conceptual framework for orchestrating modules within the `solfunmeme-dioxus` project, leveraging Clifford algebra and an 8D Riemann hypersphere with Bott periodicity. This approach aims to dynamically load modules based on their semantic representation, treating each inference step as a quasi fibration bundle of thoughts.

## Function Map and Module Placement

Each module and its constituent functions will be represented as multivectors within an 8D Riemann hypersphere. The position and orientation of these multivectors will semantically describe the code, enabling dynamic loading and interchangeability.

## Emoji Placement and Semantic Vibe

Emojis will serve as visual and semantic markers within this 8D space. Each emoji will be associated with specific code characteristics or functionalities, providing an intuitive representation of the "vibe" or semantic content of the functions and modules.

## Hierarchical Division of the 8D Space

To create a hierarchical structure within the 8D Riemann hypersphere, we will employ a division strategy based on prime factors. This will allow for a granular and semantically rich organization of the code modules:

*   **Initial Division:** The entire 8D space will be recursively divided by prime factors, starting with 1/2, then 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, 1/11, and 1/13. This creates a nested hierarchy of "quadrants" or subspaces.
*   **Prime Factor Resonance:** The prime factors used for division will semantically resonate with the content and purpose of the functions and modules residing within those subspaces, aligning with the "Introspector Meta Prompt" philosophy.

This hierarchical division will facilitate efficient navigation and dynamic discovery of modules based on their semantic properties within the Riemann hypersphere.

## Ontology Mapping and Emoji Coordinate Systems

Each element within the project's ontology will be mapped into the 8D Riemann hypersphere. To provide a coordinate system for these ontological elements, we will assign a sequence of up to 8 emojis. These emojis will visually represent the element's position and characteristics within the hypersphere.

*   **Dimensional Representation:** Each dimension of the 8D space will be associated with a specific emoji or a set of emojis.
*   **Prime Factor Emojis:** The initial division by 2 (1/2) will be represented by a single emoji, splitting the space into two conceptual halves. Subsequent prime factor divisions (1/3, 1/5, etc.) will introduce additional emojis, building a unique emoji coordinate for each ontological element.
*   **Semantic Alignment:** The chosen emojis will semantically align with the ontological element they represent, reinforcing the "vibe is the vector is the meme is the meta" philosophy.
