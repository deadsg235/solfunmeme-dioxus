# Project Ontologies and Fluid Schema

## The README as Primary Ontology

The main `README.md` file serves as the primary **ontology** and **index** for the Solfunmeme-Dioxus project. It provides a comprehensive overview of our core philosophy, goals, and the interconnected "worlds" (crates, concepts, and documentation) that constitute the Code-Math Manifold. For a complete understanding of the project's semantic structure, refer to the `README.md` as the primary entry point.

## Core Ontological Concepts

Our ontology is defined by a set of core concepts that are central to the project's vision:

*   **Code-Math Manifold**: The foundational concept of treating code as a mathematical object, enabling a unified approach to analysis, visualization, and interaction.
*   **Glyphic Code**: A vision for representing the entire project—its code, concepts, and their relationships—as a singular, semantically rich emoji matrix.
*   **Digital Secretome**: An interactive "digital secretome" in the form of a Tarot card deck, using Rust enums and Lean 4 inductives to model computational rules, semantic structures, and interactive states.

## Fluid Schema

The project's ontologies directly inform our **fluid schema**, an adaptable data model that evolves with the codebase and our understanding of it. This schema is not fixed but is instead designed to be flexible, accommodating new concepts and relationships as they emerge.

The following files provide more detailed, machine-readable representations of our ontology, which are used to generate and inform the fluid schema:

*   **`ontologies/project_ontology.ttl`**: The main project ontology in Turtle format, generated from analyzed code. *Refer here to understand the semantic structure derived from the codebase, which directly influences our fluid schema.*
*   **`ontologies/solfunmem.jsonld`**: A JSON-LD representation of core semantic concepts. *Refer here for a JSON-LD view of foundational semantic elements that contribute to the schema's flexibility.*
*   **`ontologies/zos/`**: Contains ZOS-specific ontology definitions. *Refer here for ontologies related to the ZOS (Zero-One-Space) framework, which will also be integrated into the fluid schema.*
