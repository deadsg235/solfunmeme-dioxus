# Microkernel Specification Source Documents

This file lists the core documentation used to define the specification for the `bootstrap` microkernel.

- `docs/architecture.md`: Outlines the overall system architecture, which is essential for understanding how the microkernel will fit into the larger project.
- `docs/code_math_manifold.md`: Describes the core philosophy of the project, treating code as a mathematical object. The microkernel must be aligned with this vision.
- `docs/introduction.md`: Provides a high-level introduction to the project, which helps in defining the microkernel's purpose and scope.
- `docs/overview.md`: Gives a general overview of the project, which is useful for ensuring the microkernel serves the project's main goals.
- `docs/systems.md`: Details the various systems within the project. The microkernel will be the foundational system.
- `docs/indexing_guide.md`: Provides detailed information on the indexing process, a core function of the proposed microkernel.
- `docs/guidelines.md`: Contains the development guidelines, which will be important for the implementation of the microkernel itself.
