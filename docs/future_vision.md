## Future: Advanced Querying with SPARQL

Our long-term vision includes integrating SPARQL for advanced, semantic querying of the indexed codebase. This will allow for more complex and expressive queries against the rich RDF ontology generated from your code, moving beyond simple keyword searches to truly understand the relationships and meaning within the Code-Math Manifold.
