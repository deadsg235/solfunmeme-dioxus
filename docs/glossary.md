## Glossary of Key Concepts

This glossary defines core terms and concepts central to the Solfunmeme-Dioxus project and the Code-Math Manifold.

*   **Code-Math Manifold**: The foundational concept of the project, treating code as a mathematical object that can be analyzed, transformed, and visualized, unifying code, mathematics, and meaning. (See [doc/code_math_manifold.md](doc/code_math_manifold.md))
*   **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: A tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code, used as a mathematical object for analysis and transformation. (See [doc/code_math_manifold.md](doc/code_math_manifold.md))
*   **Multivector**: A mathematical object from Clifford algebra that combines scalars, vectors, and higher-grade elements, used to represent code and embeddings in a unified, multi-dimensional space. (See [doc/code_math_manifold.md](doc/code_math_manifold.md))
*   **Bott Periodicity**: A mathematical concept from topology and Clifford algebras, echoing the 8-layered structure used to describe and map between different programming languages and meta-systems. (See [doc/code_math_manifold.md](doc/code_math_manifold.md))
*   **OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**: A decision-making framework applied to the project's development process, emphasizing continuous observation, orientation, decision, and action. (See [doc/crate_matrix.md](doc/crate_matrix.md))
*   **"File=Function=Block=Vibe" Principle**: A core architectural principle advocating for small, focused, and composable files, modules, and functions, each with a single, well-defined responsibility. (See [doc/guidelines.md](doc/guidelines.md))
*   **Monadic Structures (Result, Option)**: Rust's idiomatic types (`Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>`) used for explicit and functional error handling and managing optional values. (See [doc/guidelines.md](doc/guidelines.md))
*   **Composable Workflows**: The design principle where major functionalities are self-contained, reusable units that can be chained to build complex data processing pipelines. (See [doc/guidelines.md](doc/guidelines.md))
*   **AI Tangle Processor**: An AI-powered system for automated literate programming, generating introspective and reflective code from documentation. (See [doc/main_ideas.md](doc/main_ideas.md), [doc/next_steps.md](doc/next_steps.md))
*   **Multi-Agent Protocol**: A design for multiple AI agents to communicate and coordinate via file-based chat, enabling scalable and persistent interactions. (See [doc/cursor.md](doc/cursor.md), [doc/main_ideas.md](doc/main_ideas.md), [doc/next_steps.md](doc/next_steps.md))
*   **Executable Documentation**: The concept of converting documentation into executable specifications that can be validated and introspected by the system. (See [doc/main_ideas.md](doc/main_ideas.md), [doc/next_steps.md](doc/next_steps.md))
*   **Semantic Web Ontology**: A structured representation of knowledge using RDF/Turtle, defining concepts and relationships within the codebase to enable semantic search and reasoning. (See [doc/ontologies_details.md](doc/ontologies_details.md), [doc/main_ideas.md](doc/main_ideas.md))
*   **Cursor Protocol**: A file-based communication protocol used for stable and persistent interactions between users and AI agents, avoiding real-time chat issues. (See [doc/cursor.md](doc/cursor.md), [doc/lessons_learned.md](doc/lessons_learned.md))
*   **Ontology**: A formal naming and definition of the types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities that exist in a particular domain, central to the project's semantic understanding of code. (See [doc/ontologies_details.md](doc/ontologies_details.md))
*   **Code Vectorization**: The process of transforming source code into numerical vector representations (embeddings) for analysis, comparison, and visualization. (See `README.md` - Project Goals, [doc/overview.md](doc/overview.md))
*   **Meme (Biosemiotic Entity)**: In this context, a declaration or piece of code that appears in multiple forms, like a higher-dimensional being projected into a lower dimension, a content-addressable entity. (See [doc/overview.md](doc/overview.md))
*   **Lean4**: A formal proof assistant used for mathematical verification of properties and integration with LLMs for witness generation. (See [doc/main_ideas.md](doc/main_ideas.md), [doc/next_steps.md](doc/next_steps.md))
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)**: A cryptographic method used for proving properties without revealing the underlying data, integrated for validation and provenance tracking. (See [doc/main_ideas.md](doc/main_ideas.md), [doc/next_steps.md](doc/next_steps.md))
*   **Tantivy**: A Rust-based full-text search engine used for efficient indexing and searching of code chunks within the codebase. (See [doc/crate_matrix.md](doc/crate_matrix.md), [doc/architecture.md](doc/architecture.md), [doc/lessons_learned.md](doc/lessons_learned.md))
*   **Vendored Dependencies**: External libraries included directly within the project's repository to ensure stability and control over specific versions. (See [doc/vendor_crates_matrix.md](doc/vendor_crates_matrix.md), [doc/lessons_learned.md](doc/lessons_learned.md))
*   **ZOS (Zero-One-Space)**: A framework or tool integrated for specific functionalities, particularly in relation to the AI Tangle Processor. (See [doc/cursor.md](doc/cursor.md), [doc/ontologies_details.md](doc/ontologies_details.md))
